For those driving to the Lagoon, parking is very restricted so you may want to car share. Parking is pay-and-display, although the [leisure centre](https://www.oneren.org/venues/leisure-venues/lagoon-leisure-centre/) says you can get 2 hours free if you register your car with reception.

"Additional parking measures during busy events.
